<center> # DevGoose is now Honk Menu! Please visit [Honk Menu](https://github.com/xZeko-SRC/Honk-Menu) for the Melonloader update!

 <h2> This is a final update to the DevGoose archive. </h2>

This page is now really for Untitled Goose Game's historical purposes!

If you want the updated version please visit https://github.com/xZeko-SRC/Honk-Menu

This download includes every version of TASGoose, GooseTools, DevGoose That was made.

This does not include Honk Menu. The SMI_GUI.exe have been removed from each versions.

If you want to play any of these versions you will need to google and download SMI_GUI.exe preferably v2.5. It does state its a virus which is isn't but I can't support an injector I didn't make and I am not updating the injector..

Also please do not contact me as I DO NOT support smi_gui.exe any longer. Unless someone updates the smi_gui, all future mods will be through Melonloader. </center>


# Dev Goose

# <h2> About
Dev Goose is a mod menu for Untitled Goose Game.
BradCubed was the original creator of [TASGoose](https://github.com/BradCubed/TASGoose) where a few options were available.
xZeKo has been updating it since, including the new Mod Menu, he changed the name from TASGoose to GooseTools, then found there was another program for goose called [GooseTools](https://github.com/GrantHilgert/GooseTools) so now has changed it to Dev Goose.
DevChagrins also helped with a few bits. DevChagrins started building the multiplayer version of Goose before HouseHouse made it multiplayer [GooseNest](https://github.com/DevChagrins/GooseNest).
